### 🔗 [Click Here to Launch Project / 点击体验](https://zuanyang0809-droid.github.io/ai-slot-machine/)

A Neo-Pop interactive installation that imagines what a "day" might feel like from the perspective of an artificial intelligence.

## 🎨 Project Overview
Instead of presenting AI as abstract code, this project breaks down machine perception into three intertwined modes using a slot machine interface:
*   **Embodied Experience**: Physical forms and gestures.
*   **Sensory Perception**: Visual, audio, and tactile inputs.
*   **Intentionality**: Abstract goals and micro-narratives.

## ✨ Features
*   **Interactive Slot Mechanism**: Randomly generates combinations of AI perception.
*   **Responsive Design**: Adapts layout for desktop and mobile screens.
*   **Physical Souvenir**: Integrated "Print Card" feature designed for Canon SELPHY CP1500 (4x6" prints).
*   **Neo-Pop Aesthetic**: High-contrast colors and bold typography.

> "It treats the body as an input system, the environment as data, and the machine as an observer trying to understand the world through fragments."
